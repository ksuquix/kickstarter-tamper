# kickstarter-tamper

I made this script because I have thousands of projects backed and needed a way to only see the projects I am still waiting on for delivery.

* Auto-hide projects
  * If checked "recieved"
  * If feeling is "negative" (e.g.  I never expect to receive it at this point)
  * Uncollected (cancelled projects) pledges
* Also, it will load any notes on projects and put them into the "Messages" column, so I don't have to open every single pledge to see notes.
  * Very good to put in comments like: "Creator still talking as of 10/2022" or "Check details again on 01/2023"
